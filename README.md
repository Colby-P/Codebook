The contents of this repository were prepared for an assignment in my graduate Data Analysis course at the School of International Service, American University. Data was downloaded from the World Bank's WDI database and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation through the Our World In Data website. Data was cleaned and transformed for analysis, and codebook entries were generated describing all variables.
